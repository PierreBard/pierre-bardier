##### Abstract

We study the incentives properties of one of the central solutions to the problem of allocating divisible commodities among equally entitled agents, namely the Egalitarian Walrasian rule (EW), when agents have linear preferences. The EW rule being manipulable on this domain, we ask whether it is, at least, *immune to obvious manipulations*, in the sense of Troyan and Morrill (2020). Unfortunately, the answer is negative. This manipulability result is generic since we show that any agent for whom all the commodities are desirable has an obvious manipulation.
