##### Abstract

We propose and axiomatize a new model of incomplete preferences under uncertainty, which we call *hope-and-prepare preferences*. Act *f* is considered more desirable than act *g* when, and only when, both an optimistic evaluation, computed as the welfare level attained in a best-case scenario, and a pessimistic one, computed as the welfare level attained in a worst-case scenario, rank *f* above *g*. Our comparison criterion involves multiple priors, as best and worst cases are determined among sets of probability distributions, and is, generically, less conservative than *Bewley preferences* and *twofold multi-prior preferences*, the two ambiguity models that are closest to ours.
