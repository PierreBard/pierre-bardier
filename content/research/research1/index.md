##### Abstract

We propose a new model of incomplete preferences under uncertainty, which we call *unanimous dual-self preferences*. Act $f$ is considered more desirable than act $g$ when, and only when, both the evaluation of an optimistic self, computed as the welfare level attained in a best-case scenario, and that of a pessimistic self, computed as the welfare level attained in a worst-case scenario, rank $f$ above $g$. Our comparison criterion involves multiple priors, as best and worst cases are determined among sets of probability distributions, and is, generically, less conservative than *Bewley preferences* and *twofold multi-prior preferences*, the two ambiguity models that are closest to ours.
